# cheap-cat

A cheap cat by a newbie Racket programmer that will print the content of your file.

## Usage

```
$ raco exe cheapcat.rkt
$ ./cheapcat <your_file>
```

## Possible improvements

- Let the user choose between two modes
    - The classic print mode
    - The search mode, that would print the context where a user-provided word appears in the file
